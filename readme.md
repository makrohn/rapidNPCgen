# Rapid NPC Generator
## Purpose
To create NPCs rapidly, whether that's because your PCs went off in a completely random direction, or because you want most of a stat block that you can then tweak.
## Usage
If you call it directly, it'll ask you four or five questions:
1. Name
2. Class
3. Level
4. Race
5. If applicable, subrace
## Requirements
Python 3. That's it. Really. It's all standard modules.
Just clone the repo to get started
``git clone https://github.com/makrohn/rapidNPCgen.git``
## Classes & Races
Right now, it's all classes and races from the PHB, but racial powers past level 2 aren't in there yet.
## Scope
This isn't a character generator. I'm only interested in _possibly_ ever implementing one more question, for subclass. Anything else starts to impinge on "Rapid" and should be chosen randomly.
## Looking for help
* Get the L3+ racial powers in
* Automate more racial/class powers that affect other stats directly
* Any races or classes that are in material beyond the PHB
* Export to XML, or any other tool people would find handy (JSON is already implemented)
